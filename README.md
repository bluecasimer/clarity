# Clarity

Hello and welcome! This repository contains the source code of the Clarity app. Here you can see and learn how we used the [Clarifai Apple SDK](https://github.com/Clarifai/clarifai-apple-sdk) to make Clarity do all the cool things it does.

## Getting started

We are using CocoaPods to integrate the SDK, but in your projects you also have the option of integrating manually.

## Learn and do more

Check out our [documentation site](https://developer.clarifai.com/docs/) to learn a lot more about how to bring A.I. to your app.
